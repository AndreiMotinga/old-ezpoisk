== README

This repo is a rewrite of chogde.com using rails only.

Chogde.com is an app that was built with 2 goals in mind.

First, I really want to build this website to be a usefull place for russian speaking community in usa.

Second, I wanted to learn how ember and rails work together. Now that I had my experience I've decided to simplify the project by removing unnecessary ember front end.
Unfortunately this means doing everything pretty much from scratch. This time
I will write it doing TDD.. hopefully.



=======================

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
